# johnson-topics: Topic Modeling the correspondence of Uwe Johnson with his Leipzig friends

## Context

This repository contains data, scripts, and results that were produced for topic modeling the correspondence of Uwe Johnson (1934–1984) with his Leipzig friends. The corpus of letters that are used for topic modeling here is part of the collected works, letters, and writings of Uwe Johnson that are edited in the Uwe Johnson-Werkausgabe (http://www.uwe-johnson-werkausgabe.de/), a project of the BBAW that is carried out at the University of Rostock and that aims to make the texts available in print volumes and in a digital scholarly edition, based on XML-TEI.

The data in this repository complements the following article available in open access, which in turn goes back to a presentation at the University of Rostock in 2022:

For topic modeling, the [TMW](https://github.com/cligs/tmw) tool was used. To ensure reproducibility of the analysis, a copy of the TMW scripts used and adapted for our use case is included in this repository. For legal reasons, the full texts of the letters cannot be made available, but the metadata, corpus statistics, and analysis results are published here.

For more detailed information on how we prepared, preprocessed and analyzed the data as well as how we interpreted the results, please consult the article mentioned above.
